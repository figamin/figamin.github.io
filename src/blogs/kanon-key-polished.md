I read [Kanon](https://vndb.org/v33) back during the month of June, and it was a real enjoyable experience. Coming off of reading all of Higurashi, this felt very different and at the same time somewhat familiar. All in all, it's a great self contained story that feels like sort of a reinterpretation of the themes found in ONE, though reading that is not necessary to enjoy this.

Kanon starts off with the protagonist, Aizawa Yuuichi, arriving at a town he visited seven years ago to stay with his aunt due to his parents traveling for work, with leads to his cousin Nayuki picking him up. From then the rest of January is spent going to school, meeting girls from his past (and one who isn't), and coming to terms with how things have changed from when he last visited

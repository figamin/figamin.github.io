# about figamin.net
The wapchan blog is mostly a personal site run by [figamin](https://figamin.net), though this site will be focused more on content related to wapchan, including anime, visual novels, and tech.
## Goals
To be a hub for stuff that I like.
(it really isn't deeper than this)
This will involve news stories and writeups/blogposts.
## Inspiration
I hope to have this site be similar to [fullfrontal.moe](https://fullfrontal.moe/) or [cam](https://classicanimemuseum.wordpress.com/) in terms of news coverage.
I also really enjoy reading the content on [Rumic World](https://furinkan.com/) so I will be doing my own writeups.

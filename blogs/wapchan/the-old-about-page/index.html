    <p>On the previous (Lynxchan) form of wapchan, the about page contained a writeup I did in late 2022 about the early history of the site. I have preserved it here for posterity, complete with spelling and grammar mistakes. The original file can still be viewed on <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/figamin/WapLynx-Neo/refs/heads/master/static/pages/about.html">github</a>.</p>
<h1>Wapchan's <strong>F</strong>requently <strong>A</strong>sked <strong>Q</strong>uestions:</h1>

<p>｢what is wapchan?｣</p>
<p>Wapchan is retro content imageboard consisting of mutliple different boards covering various topics, where we strive to make a place not unlike the forums of old.</p>
<p>｢what does the name mean?｣</p>
<p>The name &quot;Wapchan&quot; was inspired by the term &quot;wapanese&quot; that used to be common on the internet in the early 2000s that meant &quot;white japanese&quot;, or someone obsessed with japanese culture, which eventually fell out of use and was replaced by &quot;weaboo&quot; due to a 4chan word filter. Since wapchan focuses on the older aspects of anime, it's a fitting name. Also, I didn't come up with it, as that honor goes to <a href="https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/229564359/#229604844%22">this</a> anon.</p>
<p>｢why are there so few boards?｣</p>
<p>Wapchan is meant to be a more focused imageboard than say 4chan or other all encompassing imageboards. Popular suggestions will most likely be added provided they fit the theme of the site.</p>
<h1>A brief history of Wapchan:</h1>
<p>｢the lum connection｣</p>
<p>Wapchan's roots can be traced back to (what was in my opinion) the golden age of /lum/ on 4chan's /a/nime board. I used to post a lot there, first starting in November 2020, and became a regular ranposter. After the threads started to go downhill back in March of 2021, I started the weekly UY storytime a month later, but that ultimately got abandoned due to the new manga translation being too far behind at the time. A few elements that would later become a part of wapchan (cytube streams and an IRC server) got their start there, and is part of the reason this site has a strong connection to Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p>｢starting out｣</p>
<p>Wapchan itself was an idea I had after thinking about the decline of /lum/ and how much better it could be if there was a site that actually moderated the threads and wasn't beholden to 4chan's secretdiscord cabal. However, I knew that UY couldn't carry a site alone like it could 20 years ago, and since I was interested in other retro anime, the idea became focused around /ar/ - the nonexistant retro anime board. Back in October of 2021 I first started discussing this idea in one of the many pre 2000s threads on /a/, and while the idea stalled out for a while (the site was originally going to use tinyIB as shown in this (following) <picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-400.webp 400w, /blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-800.webp 800w, /blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-2066.webp 2066w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-400.jpeg" alt="alt" width="2066" height="1288" srcset="/blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-400.jpeg 400w, /blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-800.jpeg 800w, /blogs/wapchan/the-old-about-page/XbaS2YRm9P-2066.jpeg 2066w" sizes="auto"></picture> image, but I found that far too limiting), it eventually picked up steam, and was put together around the same time I also made a really dumb collage for /a/, with Wapchan officially going up on New Years 2022. The earliest archived version of Wapchan can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220112234023/http://wapchan.org/">here</a>, in case you ever wondered how the site looked early on.</p>
<p>｢the first year｣</p>
<p>Since then, Wapchan has grown steadily, and while the site has always been pretty slow, it has still managed to forge a nice little community, with seven boards covering different topics. Hopefully it will continue to grow!</p>

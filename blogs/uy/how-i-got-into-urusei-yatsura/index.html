<h1>How I got into Urusei Yatsura</h1>
<h3>Posted on Jan 10, 2025</h3>
<p>It's funny, really - I wasn't an &quot;anime person&quot; when I was growing up. This is something that probably seems strange to think when you visit the sites I run, but it's true. I had a passing knowledge of the medium, but only the one that comes from the fact that anime people hang out in the same online spaces as vidya people and other nerd stuff. So I didn't really know anime at all, even as I got into college. Not much happened there when it came to anime either... at least until the pandemic stuck that March. Now I had a stupidly high amount of free time to be stuck in my house. I'd wanted to get into anime for a while - there were multiple reasons of course. One of my friends from high school watched a decent amount, stuff like Kill la Kill and Fullmetal Alchemist. But I didn't know where to hop on the train myself. Everyone I talked to said to start with Evangelion, Dragon Ball or One Piece. I wasn't interested though - I figured if I wanted to start somewhere, it would be with something a little less mainstream. Ironically I haven't seen any of these beyond clips to this day - getting around to it! Anyways, I was browsing youtube on my phone one time while sitting through the world's most boring lecture on Linear Algebra, a total snoozefest of a class, for anyone who's done matrix equations you know how long it takes to write them out! So I was on youtube and I happened to watch a video of the first opening</p>
